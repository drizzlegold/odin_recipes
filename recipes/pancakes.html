		<h2>Description</h2>
		</center>
		<p>Homemade pancakes are a treat, but they are surprisingly simple to whip up. Our easy pancake recipe uses ingredients you likely have on hand, like all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, butter, and egg. Start with our basic recipe, or try one of our variations using buttermilk or yogurt. Either way, you'll have a fluffy stack ready to eat in less than half an hour. Tip: Be sure to preheat the oven to keep the pancakes warm while you cook the restâ€”it makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate syrup </li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</li>
    
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).</li>
    
    <li>
        Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
